# CSE
This is a collection of algorithms I learned about in my [Computational Science and Engineering](cse.tum.de) program at TUM, written in Rust. \
In order to properly understand them, I wanted to implement them practically.

**Warning: This is not a proper library anyone should use. It is just a person practice ground.**
